# css-carousel
An example of a 3D carousel implemented with CSS and JQuery.

The default number of carousel items is 8. This can be changed by altering carousel-info.json and carousel-style.css. 

Note when adding or removing carousel items: You must manually edit the geometry of ALL carousel items in carousel-style.css. If this is not done, the carousel will fail to display correctly.
